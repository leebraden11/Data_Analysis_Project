	While only a range of airflow resistance values could be produced, the theoretical 
values of airflow resistance that apply to these samples fit within these ranges for all 
three samples. This implies that at our current state in our research, we have an accurate 
method of determining the airflow resistance of 3-D printed porous materials. Additionally 
verifying our method, as the length of these samples increases, the airflow resistance also 
increases, as is expected. If the airflow resistance values can be narrowed down through 
obtaining better equipment, a clearer relationship between airflow resistance and the length 
of porous materials can be established.
