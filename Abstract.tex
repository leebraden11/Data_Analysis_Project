	An important characteristic in determining the acoustic impedance of porous materials is 
the resistance to airflow in the material. This study will focus on measuring the airflow 
resistance of 3-D printed material with circular pores. The goal of this study is twofold. First, 
to design a device that can successfully and accurately measure the volumetric airflow rate through 
the porous media and the differential pressure across it in order to determine the specific airflow 
resistance of a porous media. Second, to study the dependence of the flow resistance on porous 
properties of the material. The device measures the pressure just before and just after a 3-D 
printed porous plug. The volumetric airflow rate is measured at the output end of the device. Data 
from plugs with varying lengths will be presented.
