This is a repository to store my data analysis project.

Within this repository will be the data files being analyzed,
the code that analyzes said data, and all files related to
the creation of the LaTex report. This data analysis project analyzes 
the differential pressure data of 3-D printed porous materials to 
determine the airflow resistance of said materials. This has acoustic 
implications in designing porous materials for acoustic purposes.
